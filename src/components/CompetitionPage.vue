          awards have been given for the following categories. However, NASA
          reserves the right to change the award categories. <br /><br />
          <ul class="circle-bullet">
            <li>Best Use of Data</li>
            <li>Best Use of Hardware or Technology</li>

          <br />
          Space Apps winners will be featured on the Space Apps website and
          social media, and they will receive an invitation to present their
          projects to NASA personnel (and space agency partners, if applicable).
          <br/> <br/>
          If travel is deemed safe, the winners will also be invited to visit a
          NASA site with the Space Apps Global Organizing Team to view a
          spacecraft launch. Each member of each winning team and one guest each
          will be invited and will be responsible for covering their own costs
          for their personal travel, meals and incidental expenses, and
          accommodation expenses. Winners typically conduct fundraising
          activities to cover the costs of their trips.
